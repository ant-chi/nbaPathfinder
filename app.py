    -   How does this app work?
        -   The goal of this app is to find and visualize all the shortest paths between two NBA
        players by connecting them through mutual teammates. The resulting output will be a
        collaboration network of players similar to the famous
        [Paul Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) and
        [Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) numbers in
        mathematics and film.
    -   How do I interpret a graph?
        -   Each node represents a player and each edge represents a teammate relationship. The
        source and target players are represented as large nodes with a green and red border. The
        arrows on edges provide the direction of travel from the source to the target player,
        although order doesn‚Äôt matter since this is an undirected graph.
    -   What tools did you use?
        -   Player and roster data are scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
        using requests and BeautifulSoup
        -   Basic tabular operations are done with Pandas
        -   Networkx and Pyvis are used to find shortest paths and visualize graphs
        -   Streamlit is used to build and deploy this app  :sunglasses:
    -   The graph doesn't seem correct!
        -   A majority of issues exist because data prior to the 1980-81 seasons was not scraped, so
        players that were active in prior seasons may not be accurately represented. For example,
        searching for paths between the legendary George Gervin and Larry Kenon will not show that
        they were teammates for 5 seasons on the San Antonio Spurs from 1976-1980. Some issues also
        pop up for players that have had their contracts bought out or waived since they still appear
        on a team's payroll. For example, searching for paths between Luol Deng and Lebron James show
        that they are teammates on the Los Angeles Lakers even though this is not true.
    -   Why isn't Player XYZ showing up in the search bar?
        -   Players that have logged less then 2500 career minutes or were not on an NBA roster
        during the 1980-2021 seasons will not appear in the search bar.
    -   The tooltip popups are blocking the rest of the graph.
        -   Clicking on an edge or node instead of hovering over them will hide the tooltips, while
        still highlighting connected edges and nodes.
