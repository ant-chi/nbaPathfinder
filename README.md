# NBA Pathfinder

The goal of this app is to find and visualize all the shortest paths between two NBA players by connecting them through mutual teammates. The resulting output will be a collaboration network of players similar to the famous [Paul Erdos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) and [Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon) numbers in mathematics and film.
Player and roster data is scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and cover the 1980-2021 NBA seasons.
